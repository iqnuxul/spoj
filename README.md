# spoj
- Spoj 1
    - Rewrite small numbers from input to output. Stop processing input after reading in the number 42. All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits. 

- Spoj 2  
    - Print in ascending order all such si that does not belong to Q

- Spoj 3
    - Calculate factorials of some small positive integers

- Spoj 4
    -  Adding Reversed Numbers

- Spoj 5
    - For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. 
    - There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000. 
    - For every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N). 

- Spoj 6: The Next Palindrome
    - The first line contains integer t, the number of test cases. Integers K are given in the next t lines.
    - For each K, output the smallest palindrome larger than K.
